# ProjectFlow – Video Script

---

## [INTRO]

**[On screen: ProjectFlow logo / hero page]**

Hey everyone! Welcome to ProjectFlow — a simple and powerful project management tool
that helps you and your team stay organized, hit deadlines, and work together
without the chaos.

In this video, I'm going to walk you through every feature of the system,
step by step, in plain English. Let's dive in.

---

## [SECTION 1 – Getting Started: Sign Up & Email Verification]

**[On screen: Registration page]**

First things first — let's create an account.

Click **"Get Started"** on the homepage. You'll see a simple sign-up form.
Enter your **username**, **email address**, and a **password**. Then hit **Register**.

Now, the system will send a **6-digit OTP (One-Time Password)** to your email.
This is just a security step to confirm you own that email address.

Open your email, grab the code, and type it in on the verification page.
Once confirmed, your account is active and you can log in.

**[On screen: Login page]**

Logging in is straightforward — enter your username and password and you're in.

---

## [SECTION 2 – Forgot Your Password? No Problem]

**[On screen: Forgot password page]**

If you forget your password, click **"Forgot Password"** on the login page.
Enter your email address and the system will send you a new OTP.

Enter that code along with your new password, and you're back in.
Nice and simple.

---

## [SECTION 3 – The Dashboard: Your Home Base]

**[On screen: Dashboard page]**

After logging in, you land on your **Dashboard**. This is your personal overview of everything.

At the top you'll see a warm welcome and a **"Create New Project"** button — we'll use that soon.

The dashboard is split into two panels:

- **My Projects** — Every project you manage shows up here. Click any project to open it.
- **My Tasks** — All tasks assigned to you appear here, along with their status:
  **To Do**, **In Progress**, or **Done**.

You can update a task's status directly from the dashboard using the **Actions** dropdown —
just click **"Mark as In Progress"** or **"Mark as Done"** without having to go anywhere else.

---

## [SECTION 4 – Task Calendar: See Your Deadlines Visually]

**[On screen: Dashboard → Calendar toggle]**

There's also a handy **Task Calendar** built right into your dashboard.

Click **"Show My Task Calendar"** and a full calendar view pops up.
All your active tasks are plotted on the calendar by their start and deadline dates.

You can switch between **Month**, **Week**, and **Day** views.
Clicking a task on the calendar takes you straight to that project page.

When you're done, just click the button again to hide it.

---

## [SECTION 5 – Creating a Project]

**[On screen: Create project form]**

Let's create your first project.

Click **"Create New Project"** from the dashboard or the top navigation.

Fill in:
- **Project Name** — give it a clear, descriptive name.
- **Description** — what is this project about?
- **Start Date** and **End Date** — when does work begin and wrap up?
- **Manager** — who is in charge?
- **Client** — optionally, which client is this project for?

Click **Save** and your project is ready.

---

## [SECTION 6 – Project Detail Page & Progress Tracking]

**[On screen: Project detail page]**

Click on any project to open its **Detail Page**.

At the top you'll see the project name, description, and a **Progress Bar**.
This bar automatically calculates how much of the project is done
based on how many tasks have been marked as "Done".

- Red bar means you're early on (less than 40% done).
- Yellow/orange means you're making good progress (40–70%).
- Green means you're almost there or finished (over 70%).

No manual updates needed — it updates itself as tasks are completed.

---

## [SECTION 7 – Managing Tasks]

**[On screen: Task table inside project]**

Below the progress bar is the **Tasks Table**.
This shows all tasks in the project: their title, description, who they're assigned to,
the deadline, and the current status.

**Adding a Task:**

Click **"Add New Task"** and fill in:
- **Title** — a short name for the task.
- **Description** — more detail about what needs to be done.
- **Assignee** — who should do this task? (More on this in a moment.)
- **Deadline** — when does it need to be done?
- **Status** — start it as "To Do", or set it to "In Progress" if work has already begun.

**Editing or Deleting a Task:**

Use the **Edit** or **Delete** buttons next to any task in the table.
Only the **project manager** can edit or delete tasks.

---

## [SECTION 8 – Inviting Collaborators by Email]

**[On screen: Task form — email invite field]**

Here's one of the most useful features.

When creating or editing a task, you have two options for assigning it:
1. **Select an existing user** from the dropdown.
2. **Enter an email address** to invite someone who isn't on the platform yet.

If you enter an email and that person **already has an account**, the task is automatically assigned to them.

If they **don't have an account yet**, the system sends them an invitation email with a special link.
When they click that link, they're taken to the registration page with their email pre-filled.
Once they sign up, the task is automatically linked to their new account.

This makes it super easy to bring new team members on board without any extra steps on their end.

> Note: To prevent spam, each user can send a maximum of **10 invitations per day**.

## [SECTION 9 – Team Chat]

**[On screen: Project chat page]**

Every project has its own **Team Chat**.

From the project detail page, click **"Open Team Chat"** to enter the chat room.

Here you can:
- **Send messages** — type your message and press **Enter** to send it instantly.
  Use **Shift + Enter** if you need to write a new line without sending.
- **Reply to a specific message** — click **"Reply"** on any message and your reply will be linked to it,
  making conversations easy to follow.
- **Attach files** — click **"Attach file"** to share a document, image, or any other file.
  Others can download it with one click.
- **Mention teammates** — type **@username** in your message to highlight someone's name.
- **Delete messages** — you can delete your own messages. The project manager can also delete
  any message to keep things tidy.

Only people who are part of the project — either as manager or client — can access the chat.

---

## [SECTION 10 – Your Profile]

**[On screen: Profile page]**

Every user has a **Profile Page**.

Click your name or the **Profile** link in the navigation to see it.

Your profile shows:
- Your **avatar** (profile picture)
- Your **occupation**
- Your **address**
- Links to your **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** profiles

To update any of this, click **"Edit Profile"**.
You can upload a new avatar, update your occupation, address, and social links.
Click **Save** and your changes are live.

---

## [SECTION 11 – Project & Task Permissions Summary]

**[On screen: Brief visual summary]**

Just to clarify who can do what:

- **Project Manager** — can create, edit, and delete the project and its tasks.
  They can also delete any chat message in the project.
- **Assignee (Team Member)** — can view the project and tasks assigned to them,
  update the status of their own tasks, and participate in the team chat.
- **Client** — has read access to the project and can participate in the team chat.
